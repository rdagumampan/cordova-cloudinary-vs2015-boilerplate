# cordova-cloudinary-vs2015-boilerplate
A super duper simple boilerplate solution for uploading unsigned images into Cloudinary from a [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) mobile app.

NOTE:
- Only works on actual device after deployin APK file
- Ripple seems not supporting this

I have spent wee hours trying to figure out how to upload to [Cloudinary.com](Cloudinary.com) using plain old javascript but I have failed. Then I came to know that the unsigned_upload is the simplest and best approach so far for html5 mobile apps.

Meanwhile you may check out [Cordova File Transfer](http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/fileTransfer/) for details of the API.

I hope you find this useful and I will continuously update this as I progress.
